  ## Description:
  This is a simple Travel Log Application built on the MERN stack.  It uses Mongooose and GraphQL to form a Mongo database, ReactJS for the front end and NodeJS for the backend.  With this application, a user can search for cities in a database using a Google Places API and save them to a list to create a log of a trip to a particular city, thus creating a travel log.  You must be authenticated to create a travel log, but you can sign up and authenticate.  JWS is used to mannage authentication on the routes.
  For styling, Bootstrap and SASS were employed to color the website and give it a modern feel.

  ## Usage:
  To use this application, visit the link to the deployment [here.](https://glacial-savannah-99554-420b467dec97.herokuapp.com/)
  Alternatively, you can run the project locally by cloning the repo to your local system then using a command prompt in the projects directory to install the necessary packages.  Node and React must be installed on the target environment in order to do this

  Once online, you can sign up for a user account by clicking the sign up button.  From there, you should be able to search and save cities, as well as view other user's saved cities.
